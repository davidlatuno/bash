# Bash Scripts for Trilogy Education TA

These scripts automated the adding of weekly content from the main repo to the class repo.

## Copy script

* You will need to replace the folder name of your cohort in davids_awesome_copy_script.sh
* The main repo (github) and the class repo (gitlab) have to be in the same directory or you will have to change the relative file paths
* Run this script from the Unit of the Week in the main repo
  * example: 01-html-git-css 

## Delete Script

* This script is very simple: use this in the weekly content folder to delete all of the solved folders


## Temp Copy Script
* This was a personal use case to copy the solved folders to a separate location, feel free to use or tweak as needed.
